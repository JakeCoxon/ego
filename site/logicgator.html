        <p>LogicGator or &#8216;Logic Gator&#8217; is a program I wrote for my A-level computing project. Its aim is to help A-level students visualise logic gates with the flow of logic and also to help teach them simple simplification.</p>
<p>The program was written in Visual Basic .<span class="caps">NET</span> so you will need a newish version of the .<span class="caps">NET</span> runtime.</p>

<h1>Main Canvas</h1>
<p>I first tried making each gate a .<span class="caps">NET</span> control but I ran into the problem that controls can&#8217;t easily have a transparent background. I really wanted this because gates can easily overlap and having a white rectangle under everything made the program look ugly.</p>
<p>To get around this problem I had to make my own &#8216;canvas&#8217; class and do everything manually. This meant:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creating my own control base class &#8211; this class holds a location and size.</li>
	<li>Drawing all the gates myself &#8211; the canvas class must loop through each gate and draw the appropriate image. I wanted the user to be able to show gates that were underneath other gates so when the user clicks a gate it gets brought to the top. This is done by relocating the gate in the linked list to the top.</li>
	<li>Handing mouse clicking/dragging &#8211; every time the mouse is pressed I needed to calculate which control was pressed and move it if the user was trying to drag.</li>
	<li>Handle linking nodes &#8211; The connection between two gates is drawn as a few straight lines. I had to calculate which node the user was clicking and draw the lines from it. The lines also &#8216;snap&#8217; to the nodes when the mouse gets within 10 pixels, this is to give the user better accuracy since the nodes are very small.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end it was worth it because it gave me more control over drawing.</p>
<h1>Expressions</h1>
<p>In my program, expressions are trees describing how the gates are linked up. This is so I can manipulate the circuit algorithmically.</p>
<p>To convert the diagram that a user has made into a tree I do this:<br />
First start from the gate connected to the output control.<br />
Create a tree node depending on this gate, an <span class="caps">AND</span> gate make an <span class="caps">AND</span> tree node for example<br />
If this gate is a <span class="caps">NOT</span> gate though: go back 1 step and apply it to this gate&#8217;s parent gate and invert the operator. <span class="caps">AND</span> tree nodes because <span class="caps">NAND</span> tree nodes etc.<br />
Apply this algorithm to the two inputs.<br />
When we get to an input control add an input node and stop<br />
If the algorithm can&#8217;t do something, throw an error</p>
<h1>Simplification</h1>
<p>The simplification techniques are basic. <span class="caps">NOT</span> 0 turns into 1, X+0 turns into X etc. Along with De Morgan&#8217;s laws.<br />
The algorithm searches the whole tree to find a match and then replaces it.</p>
