A simple game with 1 goal, turn all tiles green by connecting them to the source

A new take on the classic Pipes game - A simple game with one goal, turn all tiles green by connecting them to the source.

Try to beat your friends' quickest time and least amount of turns. Different sized grids are available depending on your skill level.

The game will save when you exit so you can pick it up where you left off.

This game is free and without ads, please enjoy it.
