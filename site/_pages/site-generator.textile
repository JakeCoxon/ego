h1. About

This is a small program to generate static HTML files from a templates and a textile document in a similar way to "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll . My program is slightly different because it is more based around pages and tags rather than blog posts.

Pros of using a static site generator are: Page load speed, ability to test site locally, no security issues and no server-side technology is needed other than serving HTML.

"View code on GitHub.":https://github.com/JakeCoxon/site-generator
This is the code to my personal website.

h1. Tagging

Pages/posts can be tagged with another page to be included on that page. This means any page can be a tag listing itself, different to how a lot of content management systems have tag listings on a seperate URL (eg /tags/projects). I think this is a better way to organise pages so you can use a page as a central hub of information.

h1. Meta Data

Pages + posts have optional meta data defined the same way as Jekyll. This data can be read in layouts by @arg[:key]@
